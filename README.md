## Setup
I'm messing with the idea of making this section an automated script which sets up my development environment, but considering how infrequently I switch computers and how easy it is to transfer a whole disk over, that might be a waste of time. Nontheless, here's documentation of my basic tools and setup:

- iTerm2
- Brew
  - autojump
  - fish
  - node
  - mongodb
  - ranger
  - rbenv
  - vim
  - yarn
- Sublime Text 3
